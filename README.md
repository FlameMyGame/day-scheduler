# 05 Third-Party APIs: Work Day Scheduler

This is a work day scheduler, you can use it to plan out your day as you go! As time passes the colors on each block will change from green to red, resembling the current hour in the day, to gray, signifying that time has passed the hour. You are able to type text into the boxes and save the text which is stored to your local storage, which means that even if you accidentally refresh your page, the text that you've saved will reappear.
